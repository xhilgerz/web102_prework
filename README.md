## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I found great difficulty on Challenge 3 figuring out how to create elements and append them to existing elements. However once I figured it out, the rest of the project became much easier.

I also found difficulty in trying to figure out how to style the button I added within the game-card
